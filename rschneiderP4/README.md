# INSTRUCTIONS

To run my Planning Agent program;
Files include
PlanningAgent.java
NodeSearch.java
NodeSearchTwo.java
Posn.java

you should compile and open the Grid window (java Grid) - should be pre compiled.

Next, compile the java file, (javac PlanningAgent.java) and then run it(Java PlanningAgent).
Planning Agent was built off of SearchAgent.java

Then look at the Grid window and see the agent solve the world, and find the cheese!

to add new Objects to the world, look at the code, and follow directions in comments at the following lines
300-326
370-374
517-520 <need to know the int value of the strings you wish to include.>
667-670
